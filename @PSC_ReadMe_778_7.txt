Title: Grapher 2.5
Description: Last updated Oct. 8 (optimized). This program generates 3D and 4D graphs and displays them using wireframe and alpha blended polygons. No DirectX or OpenGL are used here. The function being graphed uses interpreting to find a result. The interpreted code is in a stringgrid to simplify the compilation process. Good luck. Please Vote and comment on it.
