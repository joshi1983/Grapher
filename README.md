# Grapher

This graphs mathematical functions using a 3D visualization that changes with time.  Time is used to represent one of the dimensions to the data.

The function that is to be graphed has to be expressed by a sequence of commands in a spreadsheet.  It isn't very user-friendly but it was easier for me, the developer of this project, to have the user work harder to express the math function than write code to more carefully process all the math calculation code.  The assembly-like format from this program is processed in a more user-friendly way with my projects: COM Assembler, ASM Turtle.
